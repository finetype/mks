			<h1>Hipsters</h1>
			<p id="by">By Harsh Patel</p>


			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Hipsters refer to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subculture</a> of young, urban middle class adults and older teenagers that appeared in the <br />	1990s. The subculture is associated with independent music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, <br />
				progressive[1][2] or independent political views, alternative spirituality or atheism/agnosticism, and <br />
				 alternative lifestyles. Interests in media include independent film, magazines such as Clash, and websites <br />
				 like Pitchfork Media</p>

			<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
			<p>Hipster culture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and <br />
				behavior[s]".[3] Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that "hipsterism fetishizes the <br />
				authentic" elements of all the "fringe movements of the postwar era" beat, hippie, punk and even <br />
				grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity", and "regurgitates it with a <br />
				winking inauthenticity."</p>
